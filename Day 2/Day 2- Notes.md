## Reading Input from User
- In Python, the `input()` method is used to read input from the user via the command line. It allows you to prompt the user for input and store the entered data as a string. Here's an overview of the `input()` method.

   - `prompt` (optional): This is a string argument that is displayed to the user as a prompt or message. It provides information or instructions to the user on what kind of input is expected. The user enters their response after seeing this prompt.

## Various Keywords in Python
- Python has various keywords that serve as reserved words, which have special meanings within the language. These keywords are part of Python's syntax and cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. Some common Python keywords include `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `class`, and `def`, among others. Understanding and using these keywords correctly is crucial for writing Python code.

## How to Create a Method in Python
- In Python, methods are functions defined within a class or associated with an object. Here's how you can create a method in Python:

```python
    def my_method( parameter1, parameter2):
        # Method code here
```
